# JsSimpleDateFormat

`JsSimpleDateFormat` is for formatting and parsing date-time and duration. It formats a `Date` object
to be a string as the defined pattern. It can also parse a string to be a `Date` object based on
the defined pattern. It supports the pattern which is compatible with Java `SimpleDateFormat` and .Net
`DateTime`. For duration, it extends the pattern used by .Net `TimeSpan`. By using the same pattern
as those used by Java or .Net, it can be a benefit if you develop the backend application using Java or .Net.
